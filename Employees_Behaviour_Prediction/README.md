# HR Data Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing an HR dataset containing information about employees in a company. The dataset has 14,999 rows and 10 columns. In this analysis, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), create visualizations, and build a logistic regression model to predict employee retention.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following variables:

| **Variable**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **satisfaction_level**       | Employee-reported job satisfaction level (0 to 1)                               |
| **last_evaluation**          | Score of the employee's last performance review (0 to 1)                        |
| **number_project**           | Number of projects the employee contributes to                                  |
| **average_monthly_hours**   | Average number of hours the employee worked per month                           |
| **time_spend_company**       | Number of years the employee has been with the company                         |
| **Work_accident**            | Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work (1/0)        |
| **left**                     | Whether or not the employee left the company (1/0)                             |
| **promotion_last_5years**    | Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (1/0)             |
| **Department**               | The department the employee works in                                            |
| **salary**                   | The employee's salary (in U.S. dollars)                                         |

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore the factors that contribute to employee retention. By performing EDA, we will investigate which variables have a significant impact on employee retention (whether an employee leaves the company or stays). Additionally, we will create visualizations to display these relationships and build a logistic regression model to predict whether an employee leaves or stay at the company.
